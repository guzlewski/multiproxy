# multiproxy
Multiproxy is high performance tcp proxy server with ability to listen on many ports and send to many hosts.  
Supports up to 1023 proxies and 1024 active connections at the same time (can be increased easly if needed).  
Thanks to epoll() is very fast and low cpu usage (all operations are non blocking and edge triggered).  
It can proxy ssl traffic and files uploading / downloading (eg. scp).
